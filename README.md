BasicTextAdventure
==================

To sum it up this is my first step into programming outside of a programming class. 
I know its simple, but it is a start.
I am learning so if you catch any bugs, errors or any mishaps please explain the issue to me.
Thanks to all, long live GitHub

Summary
I'm planning to set the game up on a 2D array and linking text input commands to moving the character.
WHAT I WOULD LIKE
  Free Movement Linked to North, South, East, etc.
  Items (Weapons, Armor, Health Potions [starting simple])
  Enemies (duh)
  NPCs/Shops

I had an older version of the game, but I had made it for my class so it was buggy as hell. 
I'm starting from a clean slate now.

That being said I'm new to this and though I've had GitHub for a while this is my first true project. 
I haven't been programming for a while because of school.
Help me out please!
